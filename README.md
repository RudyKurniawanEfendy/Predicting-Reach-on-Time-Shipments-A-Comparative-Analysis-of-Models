# Predicting-Reach-on-Time-Shipments-A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Models

This study aims to predict on-time shipment delivery for an international e-commerce company using three machine learning models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The dataset comprises customer demographics, shipment methods, product characteristics, and customer interactions, with the target variable indicating whether a shipment was delivered on time. We conducted extensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features. The models were evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Despite significant efforts in data preprocessing and model tuning, the challenge of accurately predicting on-time deliveries persists due to inherent limitations within the dataset. Current conflicts in this domain highlight the inadequacy of traditional models and underscore the necessity for advanced machine learning approaches. In this context, we propose a comparative analysis of the three aforementioned models, applying rigorous hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV. Our experiments demonstrated that the Gradient Boosting model achieved the highest accuracy at 69%, outperforming both the Decision Tree and Random Forest models. However, even after optimization, the models could not surpass the 70% accuracy threshold, revealing substantial issues related to data imbalance, noise, and missing relevant features. Feature importance analysis identified shipment weight and prior purchases as significant predictors of delivery times. The study concludes that Gradient Boosting is the most reliable model among those tested.
